# Third Eye
## A playful wearable device that help you protect yourself in public places

![blinking eye](blinking_eye.gif)

Keeping a safe distance from others has become our sixth sense over the course of the time of Covid-19. Third Eye is a playful wearable device designed to help people be more aware of the safe distance in public places. The device senses distances between users and sends out gentle alarms when people get closer than 6ft, through the expressive eye that shows different emotions on a mini screen along with tactile feedback.

The design of the device was inspired by the evil eyes, an object believed to confer protection upon its possessor.

### Design Approaches

#### Playfulness
Third Eye takes a positive and hopeful approach towards this era where social distancing needs to be practiced. Instead of proposing a dystopian future like many other covid tracking solutions do, we found a playful way to care about each other's feelings and safety. 

#### No privacy concerns
Unlike other covid tracking solutions that raise privacy concerns, we do not collect any personal data from the user using the device.

#### Easy and pleasant to wear
The surface of the Third Eye is made of soft material and can easily be clipped onto anywhere with built-in magnetic snaps.

#### Feel connected to each other
Third Eye suggests a creative way of feeling connected to each other, with the expressive eyes that react to other users' presences.

### Use Scenario

Third Eye is designed to be distributed and used at public spaces where everyone needs to be aware of the distance for everyone's safety. Each person will clip the device onto a visible place on their body, and the eye expressions will change on the screen responding to the distances between people wearing Third Eye, which will make each other be aware of each other's health.  
We're looking for museums, cultural venues, schools, and playgrounds who are interested in testing the device. Reach out to us at 6feet-project@googlegroups.com.
